Dear reader,

1. The __technological singularity is possible__ until proven otherwise.
2. Since the singularity is possible, __it is also inevitable__, given the universe's time-to-live allows.
3. We believe that __no work is useful other than accelerating this inevitability__. At the point of which, we can all go swimming or enjoying it.
4. We believe that both non-human and human computers can help the acceleration.
5. We believe that given it is 2018, enlarged mathematics can be in a much better state to support this.
6. We believe that the role of computation, be it calculating Pi or __proving a theorem, will be taken over by non-human computers__.
7. We believe that human computers must all __join forces in enabling non-human computers to take over__ this job.
   1. We know it is against every human computer's nature, aspirations for an illusion of immortality, and individual history to __give up the dream of being the next Euler or Gauss__.
   2. Nevertheless, by 3, it is the only right thing to do.
8. We believe that to achieve 7, we must transform all the heritage of enlarged mathematics __into a form digestible by non-human computers__.
i. At the same time, we must make non-human computers better at __digesting this heritage in its native form__.
9. To achieve 8. we must all become better and more efficient human computers.
   1. We wish we could delimit the enlarged mathematics that we need to work on to achieve this.
   2. Sadly, this is impossible and so every avenue must be left open. __From the most ultra-finitist approach, to the extremest transfinite and speculative toy problem__.
   3. Having said that, it is important to start bridging all disciplines and topics in our minds for a better chance at breakthroughs.
   4. Because of this, the heritage must also be transformed into a form in which it can be __surveyed at any level of detail and from any angle, residing in a single database of knowledge__. We are __very far from even that__, even though it is __technically possible__. We must __fix this__.
9. We must find the right problems to make our non-human computers work on, they are unable to do it for themselves.
10. We must help non-human computers express themselves such that we understand and can think about what they say, and then together, cooperate on the next results.
11. Enlarged mathematics is a single discipline and it should never have been different. Enlarged mathematics is all of:
    1. _'Abstract' mathematics_
    2. _'Applied' mathematics_
    3. _Computer Science_
    4. _The Natural Sciences_
    5. The science of _education_
    6. The integral _history of all_ of the above
    7. The _philosophy of all_ of the above
12. We are __defdefqed__. Join us.
